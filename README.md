# sales_dashboard
Created an interactive dashboard to track and examine data from online sales, drilling down with complex criteria in the spreadsheet, and customizing using filters and slicers.
Connections were made, new tables were joined, computations were performed on the data to alter it, and user-driven parameters for visualizations were enabled.
Utilised a variety of custom visualizations (such as a map, slicers, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, and pie chart).
